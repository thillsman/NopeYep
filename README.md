# NopeYep

*"Would you like fries with that?"*

*"True"*

You'd never talk like this in real life would you? Well neither should your code!

NopeYep frees you from the artificial constraints of boolean semantics in Swift and allows you to truly express your true binary values.

### Examples
```
let friesWithThat: Bool = "yep"           // true
```
```
let isPineapplePizzaGood: Bool = "nope"   // false
```
```
let gifWithHardG: Bool = "ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"             // random true or false
```
